# Task Management Application (MERN Stack)

A simple yet powerful task management application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This app allows users to add, update, delete and tasks. It features an intuitive interface, dynamic task handling, and seamless integration between the front-end and back-end.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in to manage tasks securely.
- **Add New Tasks**: Create tasks with titles, descriptions, and deadlines.
- **Categorize Tasks**: Organize tasks into categories like `On Progress`, `Done`, and more.
- **Real-time Updates**: Tasks are automatically updated in the UI without the need for page refreshes.
- **Task Editing**: Edit task details like the title, description, and status.
- **Task Deletion**: Delete tasks once they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Database Integration**: All tasks are stored in a MongoDB database, ensuring data persistence.
